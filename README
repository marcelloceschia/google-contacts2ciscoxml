This is a horrible horribe PHP script which grabs your contacts from Google, and outputs them in a format compatible with Cisco 79xx IP Phones.

I wrote this quite some time ago, and haven't even looked at it in the last 5 months or or longer, so ff you can clean this mess up, or write your own version, please let me know!
I don't have enough time to fix this mess, and I hate PHP! :)
